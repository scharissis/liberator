# 6to5-loader

> Turn ES6 code into vanilla ES5 with no runtime required using [6to5](https://github.com/sebmck/6to5);

__Notes:__ Issues with the output should be reported on the 6to5 [issue tracker](https://github.com/sebmck/6to5/issues);

## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev 6to5-loader
```

## Usage

```
import Animal from '6to5!./Animal.js';

class Person extends Animal {
  constructor(arg='default') {
    this.eat = 'Happy Meal';
  }
}

export default Person;
```

```
var Person = require('6to5!./Person.js').default;
new Person();
```

Or within the webpack config:

```
module: {
    loaders: [
        { test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: '6to5-loader'}
    ]
}
```

and then import normally:

```
import Person from './Person.js';
```

## Troubleshooting

#### 6to5-loader is slow!

Make sure you are transforming as few files as possible. Because you are probably 
matching `/\.js$/`, you might be transforming the `node_modules` folder or other unwanted
source. See the `exclude` option in the `loaders` config as documented above.

#### 6to5 is injecting a runtime into each file and bloating my code!

6to5 uses a very small runtime for common functions such as `_extend`. By default
this will be added to every file that requires it.

You can instead require the 6to5 runtime as a separate module to avoid the duplication.

The following configuration disables automatic per-file runtime injection in 6to5, instead
bundling a single runtime and providing it to each transformed file.

```javascript
loaders: [
  // runtime=true tells 6to5 to expect a runtime, but we still need to bundle it.
  {test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: '6to5-loader?experimental=true&runtime=true'}
],
plugins: [
  // to5Runtime wants to export to the window. This loader grabs the export
  // and instead provides it to the modules that need it.
  // 
  // The 'imports?global=>{}!' is optional, but prevents to5Runtime from leaking
  // to the window object.
  // 
  // Alternatively, write `require('6to5/runtime')` at the top of your entry point.
  // Leaks the object to the window, but it's simple.
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    to5Runtime: "imports?global=>{}!exports-loader?global.to5Runtime!6to5/runtime"
  })
]
```

This can save significant overhead if you use 6to5 in many modules.
